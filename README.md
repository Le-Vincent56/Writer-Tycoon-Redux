# Writer-Tycoon
_Writer Tycoon_* is a 2D, management, simulation game where you take on the role of an up-and-coming writer. Learn new topics, genres, and research writing to better your skills and grow your audience. Amongst all of the writers, will you become the best?

This project started off as a way to hone my C++ skills, but now is more of a test to see how much I can get done within four weeks of winter break (December 20, 2023 - January 15, 2024), with a couple of days added on from Finals week. I do not plan on stopping the project afterwards, but it will be for more leisure than examination/reflection or intense learning.

## Engine
Whereas before _Writer Tycoon_* used SFML and C++, there was too much of a focus on the low-level, engine-like development for the game. The goal for the game now is feature development, which is why I have switched to Unity. The goal, this time around, is to better my skills in general programming and software architecture/engineering by practicing design patterns for modularity and scalability.
